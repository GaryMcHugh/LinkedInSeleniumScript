# LinkedInSeleniumScript
This repository contains a Selenium script I wrote in C# to register an account, get the verification code from my email and fill out the initial snapshot on LinkedIn.

I wrote this as a learning exercise to improve my knowledge of Selenium and see how I could use it in future projects.

It is not perfect as LinkedIn put recaptcha's up to prevent automated registration. Meaning that I had to step through the code and do the recaptcha's manually... Regardless, I still had fun writing this one!

Feel free to checkout the code in LinkedInProfileComplete (written in Visual Studio 2019).
